    <h1>Forty Eight Hours in Yosemite Valley</h1>
    <h4 class="date">December 2025</h4>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      <b>Day 1, 4pm:</b> Drive into Yosemite Valley at the Big Oak Flat entrance.
      Buy an “America the Beautiful” pass to cover this visit and the next year’s worth of trips.
      Nonchalantly ask the ranger, “What’s the picture on the pass?” “Still the spoonbill.
      We’re still selling 2025’s passes so nothing to worry about,” they respond, in tacit agreement
      we’re glad to have a pass that does not feature a portrait of the current U.S. president.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continue into the park, slipping a little on the icy road and thinking about the snow tires you said you’d buy
      this year.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>4:45pm:</b> Proceed directly to Sentinel Bridge. The sun is setting and the view of Half Dome
      from the bridge is legendary. Hang out a while and find a quiet spot to take it all in. Holy crap, you’re in
      Yosemite.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>5:30pm:</b> Head to Curry Village and find parking. Time to check in and find your heated canvas tent: two
      single, one double bed; sleeps three; shared bathroom/shower; exceeds expectations. Find out your key doesn’t work
      (the lock for 544 and 543 were switched, oops!) but the park staff is quite helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>7pm:</b> You’re as unpacked as you need to be. Sleeping bag is out, puffing itself up for an early bedtime.
      Food and toiletries are in the bear box.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grab the leftovers from the Cheesecake Factory-portioned lunch in Oakdale and head to the Curry Village
      Dining Pavilion. Find a table and get a beer at Bar 1899. Tastes pretty good after all that time in the cold
      sorting out the locks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>8:30pm:</b> It’s well past camper midnight and you have plans to see the sunrise, so pull out your headlamp and
      shuffle back to the tent. Navigate the central bathrooms to brush your teeth and cozy up in your sleeping bag.
      By 9:30 your eyes are closed; sleep comes easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Day 2, 5:40am:</b> Three iPhone alarms go off. Sunrise is at 6:48am and you’ve worked out
      that this is the ideal time to get up. Destination is Tunnel View a.k.a. Discovery View, the parking lot on the
      east end of the Wawona Tunnel with a vast look over the valley.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>6:40am:</b> Pull in just as color is entering the sky. It’s a dim blue. Outlines of El Capitan, Half Dome,
      Bridalveil Falls and other Yosemite icons are coming into view. There’s a crowd here for the show, but it’s the
      off season and it’s 29°F outside so it’s not hard to find a place to sit and watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>7:30am:</b> The first light touches Cloud’s Rest. Next the sun begins to wash down El Cap, starting at the nose
      and working down east-facing walls on the southwest face, adding a dimension to the monolith. Soon the whole
      valley is illuminated and you begin to thaw your fingers.

    <p>
      <b>9:00am:</b> Head back down from Tunnel View, but stop by Swinging Bridge on the way back to Curry Village.
      Yosemite Falls is now in the light, the falls reflected in the Merced. A fragile layer of frost still coats the
      meadow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>9:30am:</b> Back at Curry Village coffee awaits. There’s not much to say – it’s still below freezing, you’ve
      been up for four hours. Sadly, the baker is out and there are no muffins.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>10:30am:</b> Get your daypack and a snack from the bear box, it’s time to hike! Destination: Vernal Falls.
      Route: the John Muir Trail. It’s a steep, well-travelled trail with killer views.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coming up the first paved section, you pass Illilouette Gorge and in the distance its namesake waterfall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cross the Vernal Falls Footbridge to the other side of the Merced where the Mist Trail and JMT split at a fork.
      The Mist Trail lives up to its name – you can get more than a little damp on your way up – but it’s better left
      for warmer days with fewer crowds. The JMT in contrast is quiet enough to get a bit of solitude with the roar of
      the falls in the background.

    <p>
      Clark Point is the high point of the hike before a short descent to the falls. It’s icy right now from the recent
      rain and below-freezing nights. Just before the falls the water looks calm and inviting, belying how close you are
      to the drop off. Another hundred feet and the ground disappears. It’s a humbling experience to be so close.

      The afternoon is quickly fading. Retrace your path back down, alternating thoughts of a beer or hot chocolate
      guiding the way.

    <p>
      <b>4:30pm:</b> Retrieve the 1 Medium Pizza voucher you received at check-in (you booked during a promotional
      period, congrats!) from your tent. Don’t dawdle. The Curry Village Pizza Deck is a Yosemite institution whose food
      tastes best (1) immediately after some outdoor activity, and (2) with a beer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>7pm:</b> The last ice skating session at the winter-only Curry Village rink runs from 7pm til 9pm. It’s the
      perfect place for a free-flowing conversation as you weave in and out of the kids, parents, and one guy who seems
      like he comes here a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>9pm:</b> Bed time! See ya for sunrise.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Day 3, 6:15am:</b> This morning, Valley View, a majestic panorama of Yosemite: the imperceivably huge rocks
      miles away juxtaposed against the wandering Merced River you can reach out and touch. Find a log to perch on as
      the world wakes up.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>11am:</b> One more hike, out to Mirror Lake. There are many paths but the least popular is the best
      this time of year. Mossy granite, wood piles sprouting all sorts of mushrooms, vibrant tree bark. It’s a peaceful,
      nature-ful walk just out of sight and earshot of the main trail and road.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mirror Lake is a seasonal pool on the Tenaya Creek. Until the 1970s it was dredged for sand to make the roads of
      Yosemite more drivable this time of year. Although it’s moving, the body of water appears perfectly still and
      reflects a pair of boulders situated in the middle. It’s also a great view of the Northwest face of Half Dome
      (yes, that north face).

    <p>
      <b>2pm:</b> Driving out of the park, you pass the Ansel Adams Gallery in the main visitor center. It’s the
      official gallery of Adams’ art, home to original prints some of which are selling for north of $50k. It’s perhaps
      best they remain unsold and appreciated by the public in Yosemite rather than in someone’s private collection.
      Aptly, the gallery also sells cameras, film, and other photo equipment, perhaps inspiring the next photographer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>4pm:</b> After a late lunch, it’s time to depart. The sun sets early these days and the sky is turning colors
      as you head west to the bay. One last look, and a few thoughts about what it’ll be like in the spring.
